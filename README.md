Tips:
The hardest part for me is to convert raw data into Pandas dataframe. There are 50000+ rows with royally screwed-up format.It takes two minutes to open a csv.
I recommend you take 1000 rows first and try different models with it before going with the whole dataset unless you have GPU.
The second hardest part is feature selection. A hint: get a correlation matrix.

For model, read kernels about similar topics on Kaggle. Find kernels with one single model first,then proceed to the kernels.For me at least,Jupyter Notebook dies half of the time I do ensemble modeling.
